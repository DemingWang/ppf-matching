# ppf-matching
Matlab implementation of the Point-pair feature matching method proposed by Drost et al. [1] 

Several improvements which allow to speed-up the detection process and also to increase the detection rate are implemented. Detailed description of these improvements can be found in my [master's theses](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/62026?locale-attribute=en)
